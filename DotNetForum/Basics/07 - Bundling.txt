
Bundling and minification are two techniques you can use in ASP.NET 4.5 to improve request load time.  

Bundling improves load time by reducing the number of requests to the server and
- combines multiple file into one
- can have multiple bundles

Minification reduces the payload size of requested assets to clients 
- removes whitespace
- JS Minification
	- variable replacements and reduction in actual script characters
- CSS Bundling

ScriptBundles and Style Bundles

Enabling/Disabling
	<compilation debug="true"> - typical setting in web.config

	OR 

	BundleTable.EnableOptimizations = true/false;
	- Production ~ true
	- < Production ~ false (makes debugging easier)

Wildcards 
- when adding files from a directory, use the '*' wildcard but ONLY
  as a prefix or suffix only 

What about LESS, SCSS and others
- some are supported eg dotless

Tips
- file paths are important - check them
- make sure your bundle name and path does NOT correspond to an actual path 
	- trips up happen mainly in production
